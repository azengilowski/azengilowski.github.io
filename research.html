									I investigate learning within the contexts of cognition, affect/motivation, and identity. To understand how these learning processes are rooted in individuals’ lived experiences, I conduct qualitative and mixed-methods studies. These methodologies allow learners’ voices to shape our understanding of how learning occurs and the nuances of learning.

														How do emotions and behaviors drive learning in different environments?

											</div>
											<div class="body">
												Emotions play an important role in learning, potentially impacting students’ behaviors and teachers’ responses. I investigate confusion, an emotional and metacognitive experience, specifically how students and teachers respond to it. In addition, I consider certain behaviors or strategies students employ, like help-seeking. Help-seeking is a social, self-regulatory strategy often employed when learners face obstacles en route to comprehension. Because learning exists in a sociocultural context, developing nuanced understandings of students’ experiences and assets can aid in developing adaptive and effective comprehension strategies and systems.

														What is the role of context in learning processes and motivational experiences?
													</i>
												</b>
											</div>
											<div class="body">
												Learning is an emotionally connected, goal-directed, contextual process in pursuit of making meaning. To account for the cognitive processes and decisions students make during learning, I investigate contexts that allow students to exchange and negotiate divergent viewpoints, such as online discussions. Online discussions offer a site for investigating language processes, with a particular affordance for conversations supporting learning. I also investigate contexts such as racialized schools where race is salient due to messages/actions of students and teachers. Social inequity or racialized stressors may affect the academic motivation or performance of minoritized individuals. Encountering stereotypes, for example, can impact historically marginalized students’ psychological and emotional well-being, which can adversely affect their executive functioning, academic performance, and motivation.

														How might we revise misconceptions and challenging information?
													</i>
												</b>
											</div>
											<div class="body">
												Individuals respond in unique ways to information that conflicts with or challenges their current beliefs. Refutation texts are one proposed tactic to aid in knowledge revision processes, as their structure makes learners’ misconceptions explicit and immediately presents “corrections” to these beliefs. Refutation texts co-activate old and new information to integrate the correct understanding into long-term memory. However, the body of literature from which these assumptions are drawn has theoretical and methodological weakness, and the refutation text structure may not align with the need for critical and culturally responsive pedagogy in classrooms. These aspects pose difficulties for considering effective ways to counter misinformation and challenge deeply held beliefs.
