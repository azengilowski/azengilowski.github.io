								In my program of research, I investigate learning as it is tied to cognition, affect/motivation, and identity. To understand how these learning processes are rooted in individuals’ lived experiences, I conduct primarily qualitative or mixed-methods studies. This helps to ensure learners’ voices shape our understanding of how learning occurs and its nuances.

									Emotions and behaviors involved in learning and educational environments
								</div>
								<div>
									Emotions play an important role in learning, potentially impacting students’ behaviors and teachers’ responses. I investigate confusion, an emotional and metacognitive experience, how students and teachers respond to the experience. In addition, I consider certain behaviors or strategies students employ, like help-seeking, and their associated experiences. Help-seeking is a self-regulatory strategy, often a social process employed when learners face obstacles en route to comprehension. Because learning exists in a sociocultural context, developing nuanced understandings of the experiences and assets of specific groups of students can aid in the development of adaptive and effective strategies and systems.
								</div>
								<div>
									Questions:
								</div>
								<div>
									<i>
										What factors play a role in determining what path undergraduate students take when feeling confused during learning?
									</i>
								</div>
								<div>
									<i>
										How do first-generation students develop help-seeking behaviors and how did the pandemic impact their help-seeking processes? How do first-generation students develop and distribute capital in the context of helping/help-seeking?
									</i>
								</div>
									<div>
									<i>
										What executive function strategies do 6th graders employ when playing a card game?
									</i>
								</div>
								</div>
									<div>
									<i>
										Do K-12 teachers’ perceived expectancy, value, and cost for supporting students’ emotions differ depending on the emotion (confusion, curiosity, interest, frustration)? What factors do teachers consider when evaluating expectancy, value, and cost of supporting students’ emotions?
									</i>
