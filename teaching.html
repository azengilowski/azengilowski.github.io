									As a teacher and mentor, I create opportunities for multiple forms of engagement and creative means of expression to allow all students opportunities to show their understandings beyond verbal, in-class participation. In teaching, I value the challenge of marrying intention and impact, constantly seeking ways to address the needs of students, learn from them over the course of our relationship, and support their development as scientists, educators, and community members. My teaching is built on a central tenant: learning is a collaborative and social process, not an outcome. With this as my lens, I have three foundations that inform my pedagogical practice. First, I believe learning happens when students feel they belong, and that classroom communities must be built intentionally. Second, student knowledge and voices are important forms of knowing and should be centered in the classroom. Third, students should adapt learning beyond the classroom context, incorporating creative and community-based endeavors.

								<h2>Sample Student Evaluations</h2>
								<blockquote>
									“I cannot overstate how much I loved having Allison as the instructor for this semester. She was the most encouraging, engaging and understanding instructor I have ever had.”
								</blockquote>
								<div class="spacer"><div class="spacer-icon"></div></div>
								<blockquote>
									“Allison was single handedly one of the most understanding instructors I've ever had the pleasure of learning under. Not only has she helped me learn the best way for me to be productive in my own way, but she was a huge resource in helping me get my feet on the ground in my first experience living away from home. It's not easy to become accustomed to a new place very fast, but with this class and the amazing instructor that comes with it I was quickly understanding just how important the content I was learning would be here. Saying she was an amazing instructor doesn't even begin to express how good of a person she is. When you needed her, she was there. When something came up and it delayed an assignment, she understood and worked with you. If the world had more professors like Allison, more people would enjoy school and want to go. This class was the highlight of my week, everything about it was so good, fun, and knowledgeable. I can't thank her enough for everything she doesn't even know she helped me with. She was my superwoman this semester.”
								</blockquote>
								<div class="spacer"><div class="spacer-icon"></div></div>
								<blockquote>
									“The most effective aspects were the group activities we did based on the lectures. The group projects and reflections really tied the course work into the real-life and furthered my comprehension overall.”
								</blockquote>
								<div class="spacer"><div class="spacer-icon"></div></div>
								<blockquote>
									“Allison was my absolute favorite teacher this semester, along with the course content. She was really engaging with us, her students, throughout the semester and I felt like that positively impacted my learning experience. She truly cared for the subject she taught and for her students. For instance, she always had well-being check-ins before each class and made us aware that she was ready to either just listen to us or provide us with the resources needed to get help. She wanted to see us succeed and gave us many opportunities to do so. Further, she almost always provided feedback or comments on assignments which were always encouraging and supportive. She has all the qualities I would want in a teacher and someone I wished I could have had a lot sooner. Also, I will be definitely be transferring many of the skills I learned in her class to my future endeavors!”
								</blockquote>
								<div class="spacer"><div class="spacer-icon"></div></div>
								<blockquote>
									“The professor created a very welcoming environment to ask questions and talk to her, and I felt extremely comfortable talking to her and sharing ideas. The welcoming environment also extended to other students in class, which made the entire experience feel more unique.”
								</blockquote>
								<div class="spacer"><div class="spacer-icon"></div></div>
								<blockquote>
									“Allison was one of the better professors I've had given her understanding of the situations students have been in and the compassion she showed throughout her class to every student. She seemed to really enjoy teaching and provided genuine feedback for our assignments, indicating that she not only read our work but wanted to help us improve. Most of her assignments provided real-life benefits too and there was one that I'm really appreciative of and it still surprises me how incredibly impactful it was on improving my health.”
								</blockquote>
								<div class="spacer"><div class="spacer-icon"></div></div>
								<blockquote>
									“Allison was a great professor! She was extremely encouraging which made me more motivated to participate than I usually do. Her class activities and assignments were engaging and she made sure to throw in things to keep it interesting and relevant. Her lessons were very useful and the knowledge I have gained from this class will be used for the rest of my life.”
								</blockquote>
								<div class="spacer"><div class="spacer-icon"></div></div>
								<blockquote>
									“Allison was an amazing professor who truly showed that she cared about the well-being of her students. She was very open, understanding, and accessible to all of her students. I was unsure of keeping this course at the beginning of the semester due to my high workload but Allison reassured me that she would work with me to find a balance that suited my circumstances. She did exactly that throughout the semester and has been so understanding and responsive all semester long. On top of that, she is very dedicated and informed on the course material. She has taught us and communicated to us the material in an easy and inclusive way. This has allowed me to learn so much from this course. I truly appreciate Allison's dedication to her students and to her classes.”
								</blockquote>
								<div class="spacer"><div class="spacer-icon"></div></div>
								<blockquote>
									“A fantastic professor who really makes you think beyond just the normal curriculum that most college students take in their degree plans. She played a role in a lot of self-realizations I had, and I will forever be grateful for that.”
